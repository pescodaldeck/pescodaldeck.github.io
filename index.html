            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a bit of a wildcard: I'm a python programmer, a sysadmin, a videographer, an activist and overall a creative person. Born and raised in Italy (still living here btw), I've always lived around technology. My father used to work in IT, I was amazed by what he was capable of and I inevitably ended up following his steps. Can't say it's all been birds and flowers tho, since this passion of mine rarely met any of my peers' interests. Social life apart, I think I've learned a lot about life through computers and the likes. Surely can't regret following this path :)</p>
            <p>Either way, I don't know how or why you ended up here, but still, it's nice to see you!</p>
